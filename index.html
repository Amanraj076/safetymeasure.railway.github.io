            <h2>Safety measures to be taken in railway</h2>
            <p>Here are some essential tips for railway safety</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular Maintenance: Ensure that tracks, signals, and other infrastructure are regularly inspected and well-maintained to prevent failures.</li>
                <li>Signal Systems: Implement reliable signal systems to communicate between trains and control centers. This helps in preventing collisions and ensuring safe distances between trains.</li>
                <li>Speed Limits: Enforce and adhere to speed limits, especially in areas with curves, switches, and intersections. Speed limits are crucial for preventing derailments.</li>
                <li>Education and Training: Provide comprehensive training for railway staff, including train operators, maintenance crews, and signal operators. This education should cover emergency procedures, safety protocols, and the use of safety equipment.</li>
                <li>Emergency Response Plans: Develop and regularly practice emergency response plans for various scenarios, including derailments, fires, and natural disasters. This ensures a swift and organized response in case of an emergency.</li>
                <li>Level Crossings: Implement safety measures at level crossings, such as barriers, warning signs, and audible signals, to prevent collisions between trains and vehicles or pedestrians.</li>
                <li>Regular Inspections of Rolling Stock: Ensure that trains are regularly inspected for mechanical issues, and implement a strict maintenance schedule for rolling stock.</li>
                <li>Technology Integration: Embrace advanced technologies such as Automatic Train Protection (ATP), Positive Train Control (PTC), and Collision Avoidance Systems to enhance safety.</li>
